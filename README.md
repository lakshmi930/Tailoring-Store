# Tailoring-Store using C# & dotnet

This project was created by me and my fellow classmate Dhanya. 

The project was developed for a tailoring store which was impacted due the COVID-19 situation. Small businesses were down as there was no communication possible across the borders of two countries. No new orders came in (except from old customers). A user can customize the fabric, embroidery along with any custom handicrafts or even provide measurements with tutorial videos on 'how to take each measurement'.

The website was also hosted on a local server and presented as part of university project. The university had put certain requirements with respect to frameworks and technologies which is as following:

Frameworks include: DOTNET, C#, Bootstrap

Database: MySQL
